##Rain and Cold

a vase- beyond repair
destroyed by your blackart
yet I try to convince my buds
as if everything went fair
for shivering rain and cold,
is only when you remind
the warmth and the sunshine,
when no longer you can find.
a plea to lower your price
of those times that I sent you,
for my love found no place
for you control my market crew
fate of every dazzling sun
bloodshed in the horizon
I can't stop, but I can cry
no mercy in the velvet sky
when the hills can't behold
tears of heaven- drops of rain
peace beyond the murky clouds
people call it peace of grave.
