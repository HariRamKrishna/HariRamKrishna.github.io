Thank you for stopping by.
this space is left as a place to dump my poems. 





## Rain and Cold

a vase- beyond repair

destroyed by your blackart

yet I try to convince my buds

as if everything went fair

for shivering rain and cold,

is only when you remind

the warmth and the sunshine,

when no longer you can find.

a plea to lower your price

of those times that I sent you,

for my love found no place

for you control my market crew

fate of every dazzling sun

bloodshed in the horizon

I can't stop, but I can cry

no mercy in the velvet sky

when the hills can't behold

tears of heaven- drops of rain

peace beyond the murky clouds

people call it peace of grave.

### Flares
turbulence of my tears

ink follows the trails,

stems from your echoes

every words I engrave.

maybe thousands like me;

you must have met before.

methinks sometimes alone,

soul could be of stones!

I wait for tram you catch

to see you little more;

but blind eye you turn 

what had I done?

how simply could you

confiscate my heart; and

tear my feelings apart

leaving no way to glue.

beforehand  you biff,

I suggest you to mix 

poison in your whiff,

and  hew of you lips.

your kissers ne'er need 

to  strive pain - of my kind

they shall die - intoxicated

before they bleed.

enough is your beauty

make the whole world  blind!

methinks maybe god knows

complexity of your mind!

I had never imagined

I could be your ridicule!

and my heartbreak flares,

could turn into fuel!

### Abandoned
long for sublimed dream,

playful days in sunbeam.

forlorn pages; rusty shelves,

dog-ears and coffee stains.

salvage to abandoned feelings

to faded smiles, lost in crowd

to muted voices; and words unheard

to hurted egos; our craze absurd!

prayers to strangled emotions,

to parallels meeting at infinities.

no longer a child; no more fun.

yet; little dumb, little stubborn.

divergent trails; worthless strife!

swayed by twists of fate in life.

your brushstrokes, color of my sky

flew the time; in blink of an eye.

### An ode to the prostitute

the cost of living

has raised

to such an extent

she put herself in sale

to pay her rent

she feels schizoid

she moans in pain

people take pleasure 

over her misfortune

time and again

she merely encounters

the people with soul

they greet her hello'

when she meets them

somewhere again

they seek love

but she is 

numb and shattered

no part of love 

left inside her

for she has been  

reduced into quarks

mystery to the saint

and nobody can ever

break her again

she looks into mirror 

and  persuades herself

'I don't look like a whore'

for there shall be reasons

'why my life ain't  fair'?

---------------------------

### Madness in the street

blank page awaits, 

ink - about to die.

long for your shadow 

strangers passing by.

hunger, thirst and pain

indebtedness to rain

for i have teardrops to hide

yet, my words flow aside.

although you knew

i couldn't afford 

stars for you; but thankyou!

for time you spent.

when you parted  from me,

profoundly desperate i became.

clouds of chaos in my sky

like dreamers' after their dreams die.

sad-story behind curtain

walls of our freedom 

-the societal structures

where our love couldn't  fit in.

decades passed since you left;

but  you  have always been

reason to write, you are still

inspiration to my poems.

I  blame no one, but my fate

for I live in the same street;

where we first met.

amid dogbarks nowadays!

a kind of trade-off game,

i like to play with them.

I share my poems to get

compassion in return.

I don't care about love

for my life has been

something more akin

to a movie scene.

modern couples do have

more epic love story than ours!

time shall be  moving that fast.

even a week- their love can't last.

### - Analepsis 
flowers of rhododendron 

bushes covered in  red

and the chirping of birds

hours of pot-game; we played 

I used to collect firewood

you were kitchen chef

ducklings were our kids

mimicry in the shade.

five ducklings:

-part of our whim

we guided them to water;

so they could  swim.

how could you ignore

the days we  cried

and months we mourned

when our little duckling died.

you must remember

we used to put

flowers on her grave

to pray her soul everyday.

we used to run over the bridge

so it could catch the wave

and shake to let it resonate.

you may pretend  to forget.

but even in the cloudburst rain

we used to embrace 

before we unclasp our hands

with a promise to meet again.

you read fairytales under the pine

I still have your storybook.

i wonder how you overlook

at our promises, though its fine!

what happened to our love

and thousand kisses that we  made

for the woods are still alive

with your handwritings and our names.

I hope by now you have recovered

our memories of  past

for they could have been

obliviously formatted.

plethora of restore points

fortunately we had set

to retrieve entire flashback

of bygone childhood days.

for you have been far apart

and out of touch for years

for you left without  goodbye

and i miss you everyday!

-------------------------------

### - Forgive me my dreams
forgive me my dreams,

spontaneously broken

promises I made,

yet, to let you know, i write

I was tryin' to survive 

till my last hope died.

yes it stinks 

my very innate instinct

my dead ended madness

like a body, rotten 

of once a brave

invincible warrior.

the way we used to convey

suddenly stopped working

like first order phase transition

the inevitable disaster i knew

audience deafened and blinded

and i left earlier.

so I walk dead

in perfect silence,

tunneling through pitch dark

the only irrefutable option

amid fish-frog finger play 

was there other way?

we can yet recover

in theory, in philosophy

the order and the peace

setting large correlation length 

of curiosity in mind

all it takes is seeding.

I hope one day

we would self assemble,

for we must find a way

to put theory into practice

to delay expiry date,

before its too late.

Anyway, thankyou

for your capitalism lecture,

I am obliged to sway. 

the solace of shadows,

star-chase for sure,

how could I betray!

### - God's Plan

moments you create, memories you share,

tears you wipe, for outcries are rare!

let your handshakes make them proud,

for life is not just a- funeral crowd. 

the farewell you bid, to sunset at breeze,

burnt over the mountains of- sequoia trees.


the persona you exude, philosophy you care

the kindness you offer, the loyalty you bear.

the vibes you set, the beauty in the air,

the hands you lend, when they are near

for life is not just a funeral crowd.

cry not alone, see wolves make fun around!

for lord has plan over our every defeat

priorites he sets are, ne'er a misfit.

we rise by giving, see time unfold,

the story of life, the journey untold.

having lived each day, with passion & zeal

traceless be our egoes, till expiry date.

legacy so vibrant, that ocean would feel,

the embrace of our soul, before its late!
