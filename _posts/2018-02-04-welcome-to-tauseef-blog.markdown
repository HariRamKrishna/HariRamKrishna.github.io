First of all, Thank you for stopping by.

# Who am I?
Hi, I am `Hari Ram Krishna Gauli`, a *Physics undergraduate* and a *Technology Enthusiast* from Chitwan, Nepal who loves to code for intractable problems of real-life. 

I was born in Bharatpur, and I did my BSc degree in Physics from [Tri-Chandra Multiple College, Ghantaghar][csu-chico] affiliated to Tribhuvan University and graduated in year 2020.

I have about 3 years of experience of Optimization and Data Analysis in Python. I am aspiring to learn, grow and share the knowledge. I started real world programming from the year 2019, when I did my project work on map coloring using DWAVE. I am constantly looking to work on exciting projects.

#### I believe in the statement -

# What is this site about?
Starting a blog and creating an online presense, to share my learnings was always on my to do list. Finally today I decided to start doing it.
I want to use this site as a place to share my experiences with interesting programs in problem solving, hoping it would help someone join coding.
